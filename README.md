## 1. Idea Overview  
Each summer, thousands of people circle Lake Balaton by bike or foot, seeking the perfect place to rest. But what makes a bench perfect? Is it the view, the temperature, the breeze, or the warm sun on your back?  
A small IoT device was placed under one of Balaton’s most iconic benches to find out. It senses when people sit, how warm and humid it is, and how much sun hits the bench. It even lets passersby vote: “Nice Spot!” or “Too hot!” All the data flows into a colorful website, complete with real-time comfort ratings, weather alerts, and QR codes for each bench.  
Think of it as TripAdvisor for benches.
